## Intro

> This guide assumes that you at least have downloaded go.

If you haven't installed Google's protocol buffer compiler (protoc), see the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) at the bottom before continuing.

When you have protoc downloaded, you can start by following the [Setup of a new repository](#setup-of-a-new-repository), which should show you how to start making your repository structure and how to run the different things. While setting up your repository, go to the appropriate sections explaining the basics of what to do in each file. If the sections don't explain it well enough, you can compare your code to the working code example in this repository or ask for help. I would very much appreciate feedback if you have any ðŸ™‚.

## Setup of a new repository

1. Make ``go.mod`` file with:

    ```sh
    go mod init <link to a GitHub repo without "https://">
    ```

    Your repo should be on the public GitHub as it needs to be an accessible web page.
    > If you don't want to use a GitHub repository to keep it simple but differ from the standard, you can call it something like `incrementer.com`, as that would fit the name of this example.

2. Make a ``.proto`` file in a sub-directory, for example, ``proto/template.proto``, and make your service. See [The Proto file](#the-proto-file) for info on what to add to the `.proto` file

3. Run command:

    ```sh
    protoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative --go-grpc_out=. --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative proto/template.proto
    ```

    The command should create the **two** ``.pb.go`` files. Remember to change "proto/template" to your directory and file name if you have another file structure.

4. Run command:

    ```sh
    go mod tidy
    ```

    To install dependencies and create the ``go.sum`` file.

5. Implement your client and server. Take a look at [Implementation](#implementation) for instructions.
6. Open a terminal for each client and server and run them with:

    The Client: `$ go run .\client\client.go`

    The Server: `$ go run .\server\server.go`

## The Proto file

### What is it?

The proto file defines a standard of communication, aka. a protocol. For us proto will be used to define the way we communicate between our servers and clients. We can use the proto file to compile methods for us to use in our code. So if you make changes in the proto file, then you will have to recompile it, before you can see any changes in your code.

### Required lines

1. To make sure to use the newer proto syntax, you will need to add the syntax version as the first line in the file.

   ```protobuf
    syntax = "proto3";
   ```

2. We need to tell the compiler what the go package name of the `pb.go` files should be. It is gonna use the last part of the path as the name of the package, but it matters little, it just needs to be unique. The example below will make the package name "proto"

    ```protobuf
    option go_package = "github.com/PatrickMatthiesen/DSYS-gRPC-template/proto";
    ```

    or

    ```protobuf
    option go_package = "proto";
    ```

3. Add a package name that is the same as the last folder from above ("proto" in this example)

    ```protobuf
    package proto;
    ```

### Defining a Service

1. Make a service with a telling name. Here the name of the service is `Template`, It's a bad name but it is a name.

    ```protobuf
    service Template
    {
    }
    ```

2. Add RPC endpoints/methods to the service. The endpoint will start with `rpc`, followed by the name of the endpoint, a message type to send, and a message type to receive. We have not made the message types yet, but we will do that next.

   Here we make an endpoint called `SayHi`, which sends a message type called `Greeting` and expects to receive a response of a type called `Farewell`.

    ```protobuf
    service Template
    {
        rpc SayHi (Greeting) returns (Farewell);
    }
    ```

    An endpoint can also be streamed, so more than one message or response can be sent. You can stream either the message or response, or both if you need to. Here is an example that streams message and response:

    ```protobuf
    service Template
    {
        rpc SayHi (stream Greeting) returns (stream Farewell);
    }
    ```

3. To complete the endpoint we need to make the message types. The message types have a name and a type for each field. The field type can be a primitive type like `string` or `int32`, or it can be another message type that you have made. After the type, you need to add a number that is unique for each field. The number is used to identify the field in the message. The number can be any number, but it is recommended to use 1, 2, 3, etc. in the order you want the fields to be in the message.

    ```protobuf
    message Greeting {
        string clientName = 1;
        string message = 2;
        ...
    }

    message Farewell {
        string message = 1;
    }
    ```

   - notes:
     - All names of services, endpoints, and message types should be in CamelCase
     - an example can be found in [template.proto](proto/template.proto)

4. Now that we have defined our service we want to compile the go files. We do so by running the following command:

   ```sh
   protoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative --go-grpc_out=. --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative proto/template.proto
   ```

   > remember to change the path `proto/template.proto` to the path of your proto file.

## Implementation

For this section, we go over how to implement the server and client parts of the service you created in [Defining a Service](#defining-a-service). This guide shows how to make a client-server architecture, but this guide will not show how to do a client-to-client architecture.

### Implementing the server methods

1. Import the proto file and grpc packages.

    ```go
    import (
        ...
        // this has to be the same as the go.mod module,
        // followed by the path to the folder the proto file is in.
        gRPC "<your go.mod module path>/proto"

        "google.golang.org/grpc"
    )
    ```

2. Make a "server" struct
   - It does not need to be called `"Server"`, but it's just what makes the most sense in this case.

    ```go
    type Server struct {
        // an interface that the server type needs to have
        gRPC.UnimplementedTemplateServer
        
        // here you can implement other fields that you want
    }
    ```

3. Make a method that matches the endpoint in your proto file and add `(s *Server)`. This attaches the method to the server struct so it can run when someone calls our endpoint.
   - For an endpoint that does no streaming, then we need to give the method a context and the input type. For the return, we need to return a pair of your return type and an error.

    ```go
    func (s *Server) <endpoint name>(ctx context.Context, <name> *<input type>) (*<the return type>, error) {
        // some code here
        ...
        ack :=  // make an instance of your return type
        return (ack, nil)
    }
    ```

    - For an endpoint that streams messages, we need to give the method a message stream and return an error. In this case, you get the input from the stream and send the return type back over the stream too.

    ```go
    func (s *Server) <endpoint name>(msgStream gRPC.<service name>_<endpoint name>Server) error {
        // get all the messages from the stream
        for {
            msg, err := msgStream.Recv()
            if err == io.EOF {
                break
            }
        }

        ack := // make an instance of your return type
        msgStream.SendAndClose(ack)

        return nil
    }
    ```

4. Serving the endpoint

   - Make a main method where you can add the code from the next steps

    ```go
    func main() {
        
    }
    ```

   - Listen on a port. If you add localhost then it is only running locally (on your computer), if you remove it, then it will open the port on your computer to others. If the port is opened then you should get a firewall prompt that you should approve.

    ```go
    list, _ := net.Listen("tcp", "localhost:5400")
    ```

   - Make a grpc server

    ```go
    grpcServer := grpc.NewServer(opts...)
    ```

   - Make an instance of your server struct

    ```go
    server := &Server{
        // set fields here 
    }
    ```

    - Register your server struct. Remember that you need to change `"Template"` to what your service is called.

    ```go
    gRPC.RegisterTemplateServer(grpcServer, server)
    ```

    - Start serving the server. This will block the main method until the server is stopped.
    > Serving means that the server is listening for requests on the port you gave it.
    >

    ```go
    ...
    grpcServer.Serve(list)
    // Code here will not run as .Serve() blocks the thread
    ```

### Calling endpoints from the client

1. Import the proto file and grpc packages.

    ```go
    import (
        ...
        // This has to be the same as the go.mod module,
        // followed by the path to the folder the proto file is in.
        gRPC "<your go.mod module path>/proto"

        "google.golang.org/grpc"
        "google.golang.org/grpc/credentials/insecure"
    )
    ```

2. Make dialing options with insecure credentials, as we don't have something called a TLS certificate (which is used for encryption).

    ```go
    var opts []grpc.DialOption
    opts = append(
        opts, grpc.WithBlock(), 
        grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials())
    )
    ```

3. Dial the server. Here we just go the port locally, but if you want to connect to another device, then you would just add the IP of the other device. (use ``ipconfig`` in the terminal or call ``GetOutboundIP()`` which can be found in [server](/server/server.go))

    ```go
    conn, err := grpc.Dial(":5400", opts...)
    ```

4. Make a client that has the endpoint methods. Remember to change `"Template"` to what your service is called.

    ```go
    server = gRPC.NewTemplateClient(conn)
    ```

5. Now you can just say `server.<endpoint name>` to call the endpoint

6. For streamed endpoints.
   - You call the method with a context, to get the stream.

    ```go
    stream, err := server.SayHi(context.Background())
    ```

   - Then you can call send on the stream with the message type of the endpoint stream. Could be done in a loop or however you want.

    ```go
    message := // make an instance of your input ty
    stream.Send(message)
    ```

    - When done sending messages, you need to close the stream and wait for a response from the server.

    ```go
    farewell, err := stream.CloseAndRecv()
    ```

## Code Snippets

For later weeks you might need some of the following snippets for the assignments.

### Log to a file

The following code can be used to log to a file instead of the console.
You can use it by calling `f := setLog()` in the main method, just remember to call `defer f.Close()` after it.

> Don't know `defer`? Check out this sample: <https://gobyexample.com/defer>

```go
    // sets the logger to use a log.txt file instead of the console
    func setLog() *os.File {
        // Clears the log.txt file when a new server is started
        if err := os.Truncate("log.txt", 0); err != nil {
            log.Printf("Failed to truncate: %v", err)
        }

        // This connects to the log file/changes the output of the log information to the log.txt file.
        f, err := os.OpenFile("log.txt", os.O_RDWR|os.O_CREATE|os.O_APPEND, 0666)
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatalf("error opening file: %v", err)
        }
        log.SetOutput(f)
        return f
    }
```


## Prerequisites

### Download protoc on Windows

1. Before starting, install Google's protocol buffers:
    - Go to the latest release of the protobuf repository: <https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/latest>
    - Find the version you need and download it.
    - As of July 2023, if you are on Windows, it's the third from the bottom, `protoc-21.7-win64.zip`.
2. Unzip the file and place it in a folder you won't move or delete.
    - On my Windows machine, I placed it in `C:\Users\<username>\go`
    - I chose to rename the folder to `Protoc`, so the path of the folder is `C:\Users\<username>\go\Protoc`
3. Add the path of the `bin` folder to your system variables.
    - On Windows, press the Windows key and search for `edit the system environment variables`.
    - Click on `Environment Variables...` at the bottom.
    - In the bottom list select the variable called `Path` and click on `Edit ...`
    - In the pop-up window, click on `New`
    - Paste the full path of the `bin` folder into the text field.

        My path is `C:\Users\<username>\go\Protoc\bin`.

    - Click `OK` twice.
4. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

    `$ go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest`

    `$ go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest`

### Download protoc on Mac OS

`$ brew install go`

`$ brew install protoc-gen-go`

`$ brew install protobuf`

`$ brew install protoc-gen-go-grpc`
